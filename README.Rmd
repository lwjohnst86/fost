# fost: Formatting and Style Templates for (biomedical) journal submission

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

Similar to [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package, but targetted
to biomedical journals.

Will fill this out in time.
